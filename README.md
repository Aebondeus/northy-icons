# Icons library for my study eShop project

## Built on VueJs3 + Vite

### Frankly, I don't think that someone will ever see this repo
#### But still...

If you really want to fork it **(why?)** and add icon - paste it to `src/icons` in 
Vue's `<template>`-tag.

After that - run `yarn build` and commit it. You're magnificent!
